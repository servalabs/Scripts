## **0. Overview**

- **Purpose:**  
  Manage server operations via three modes—Destroy, Restore, and Support—while ensuring edge cases (based on file deletion status) are properly handled.
  
- **Key Features:**  
  - **Destroy Mode (F1):** Securely erase sensitive data and stop critical services.
  - **Restore Mode (F2):** Retrieve data from backup and restart services.
  - **Support Mode (F3):** Enable remote access (Cloudflare tunnels and Cockpit).
  - **Local State Management:**  
    A JSON file holds a "deleted_flag" and timestamp to track if sensitive data has been removed.

---

## **1. System Architecture**

- **Components:**
  - **Primary Server (atom1):** Contains sensitive data and critical services.
  - **Backup Server (atom2):** Manages backup and restoration operations.
  - **Flag Management:**  
    Polls the dashboard (`https://techgg-clicky-flag-dashboard.onrender.com/flags/`) to obtain F1, F2, and F3 and parse it.
- Output Example from https://techgg-clicky-flag-dashboard.onrender.com/flags/
```json
[{"_id":"67e81204224c84d6eef11475","name":"F1","enabled":false,"label":"Danger","description":"Self Destruct & ShutDown","updatedAt":"2025-03-29T15:30:12.542Z","__v":0},
{"_id":"67e81204224c84d6eef11476","name":"F2","enabled":false,"label":"Restore","description":"Self Restore & Start Apps","updatedAt":"2025-03-29T15:30:12.543Z","__v":0},
{"_id":"67e81204224c84d6eef11477","name":"F3","enabled":false,"label":"Support","description":"Allow remote access for support","updatedAt":"2025-03-29T15:30:12.544Z","__v":0}]
```
  - **Consolidated Manager Script (`ct_manager.sh`):**  
    Handles flag polling, state updates, script execution, and basic logging.
  - **Local State File (`/etc/ct/state.json`):**  
    Records minimal state details, including:
    - `deleted_flag` (yes/no)
    - `last_transition` timestamp
    - Other action logs as needed.
  - **Systemd Timer/Service:**  
    Executes the consolidated script at regular intervals (every minute) with error checking.

---

## **2. Operational Flows & Edge Case Handling**

- **Destroy Mode Flow (F1 Active):**
  - **Condition Check:**
    - If F1 is active **and** either:
      - `deleted_flag` is **no**, **or**
      - Sensitive files still exist  
    **→ Execute deletion script:**  
      - Securely erase files (e.g., in `/files/20 Docs`).
      - Stop Tailscale, Syncthing, CasaOS.
      - Update local state: set `deleted_flag` to **yes** with a timestamp.
    - If F1 is active **and** `deleted_flag` is **yes** **and** sensitive files do not exist  
    **→ Simply shut down.**
  - **Logging & Error Checking:**  
    Each step logs its success/failure.

- **Restore Mode Flow (F2 Active):**
  - **Condition Check:**
    - If F2 is active **and** `deleted_flag` is **yes**  
    **→ Execute restoration script:**  
      - Restart Tailscale, Syncthing, CasaOS.
      - Restore files from backup (atom2).
      - At completion, update local state: change `deleted_flag` to **no**.
    - If F2 is active **and** `deleted_flag` is **no**  
    **→ Do nothing.**
  - **Logging & Error Checking:**  
    Actions and errors are recorded.

- **Support Mode Flow (F3 Active):**
  - **Condition Check:**
    - If F3 is active and Cloudflare tunnels and Cockpit are **off**  
    **→ Enable remote access:**
      - Execute support script with "enable" parameter.
    - If F3 is inactive and Cloudflare tunnels and Cockpit are **on**  
    **→ Disable remote access:**
      - Execute support script with "disable" parameter.
  - **Logging:**  
    Records mode transitions.

- **Backup Server Behavior:**
  - Uses systemd timers for scheduled startup/shutdown.
  - Adapts to active flags (F1/F2) to either remain powered or shutdown.

## **3. Implementation Details**

- **Consolidated Script (`ct_manager.sh`):**
  - **Functions:**
    - *flag_polling()*: Retrieves flag states from the dashboard.
    - *state_management()*: Reads/writes the JSON state file using `jq` (including `deleted_flag` and timestamp).
    - *execute_script(mode)*: Dynamically fetches the corresponding script from GitHub (with commit SHA validation) and executes it.
```bash
execute_script() {
    local mode="$1"  # Accepts "destroy", "restore", or "support"
    local sha
    sha=$(curl -fsSL https://api.github.com/repos/servalabs/Scripts/commits/main | jq -r '.sha')
    bash <(curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/servalabs/Scripts/${sha}/${mode}.sh")
}
```
   - *basic_logging()*: Writes simple timestamped log entries to `/var/log/ct.log`.
  - **Error Checking:**  
    - Validates exit statuses after every command.
    - Logs errors and halts further actions if critical errors occur.
- **Dynamic Script Fetching:**  
  - Each time a mode-specific operation is triggered, the latest script (destroy, restore, or support) is fetched securely from GitHub (The GitHub Account is of user only, so don't worry)
- **External Tools:**  
  - Uses `curl` for HTTP requests.
  - Leverages `jq` for JSON parsing.
  - Continues to use systemd timers for scheduling.

## **4. Deployment & Maintenance**

- **Directory Structure:**
  - `/etc/ct/` – Contains the JSON state file.
  - `/usr/local/bin/` – Contains the consolidated manager script.
  - `/var/log/ct.log` – Basic log file for operation records.

- **Setup Steps:**
  1. Create necessary directories.
  2. Place the consolidated script and set executable permissions.
  3. Initialize the JSON state file with a default structure (e.g., `"deleted_flag": "no"`).
  4. Install and enable the systemd service and timer.
  5. Perform a dry-run to verify correct state transitions and logging.

- **Maintenance:**
  - Monitor `/var/log/ct.log` for errors.
  - Periodically update GitHub scripts as required.
  - Use manual commands for state file resets during troubleshooting if necessary.

```bash
# Check Output
journalctl -u ct_manager.service

# Live Run
sudo /usr/local/bin/ct_manager.sh
```
